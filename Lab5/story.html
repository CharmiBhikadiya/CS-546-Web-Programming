                <h3>My Story</h3>
               <P>I am a person who always has a smile on my face. I don't like to be sad or be dull at any given point of time.
                    Whenever I come across any difficulties in my life I get depressed for a few minutes as I am a human being and I too have emotions.
                 But again, I will tell one thing to myself life is short you can't waste time by being sad just cheer up. 
                 You are the one who needs to face the challenge whatever it is you have to overcome this situation.
                    Be brave and accept the challenge with a smile and then you will feel it was such a small hurdle.</P>
